    <span id="output">I was glad that today we're together. I feel different since that day I met you; you changed my perspective on life. You put color in my once-lonely beliefs about love. Sometimes we go somewhere, and I find myself staring at you because you are the most precious and beautiful woman I have ever known. Even when we have small arguments, you stay the same and manage things perfectly. I want to thank you for being the best woman to come into my life. <br><br>-Harold</span>
